# My Xmonad Config
In this repo, you will find the configuration files I use on my build of Arch Linux using the Xmonad window manager.

## Installation
On a fresh installation of Arch Linux, download git with
```
sudo pacman -S git
```
and then clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/jacob-earle/XmonadConfig.git
```

Then, you can use the simple shell script provided to install the necessary dependencies to the system
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

Now, reboot your system and you should boot onto the lightdm login page!

Enjoy!!!
